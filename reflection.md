What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think the hardest part was figuring out what functions would go in what class, but I think there are several different ways to make it work, so for someone in the future, I would advise them to simply go with what makes the most sense to them. I planned out where to put my methods and what my methods should each do ahead of time, which was super helpful in breaking down the tasks. I had trouble with the syntax related to calling things from different classes, but I just picked through my code slowly and used the error messages to help me fix my code. Another big piece of advise I would give is to start early, because when I struggled with my code, I had peace of mind knowing that I had time to work through it, and also the opportunity to go to office hours or tutoring if I was unable to identify the issue.
